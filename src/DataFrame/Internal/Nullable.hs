{- | Nullable-aware binary operations for expressions.

This module provides two type classes, 'NullableArithOp' and 'NullableCmpOp',
which enable operators like '.+', '.-', '.*', './', '.==' etc. to work
transparently across combinations of nullable (@Maybe a@) and non-nullable
(@a@) column types.

The partial functional dependencies uniquely determine the result type from
the operand types, so GHC infers it without annotations.

The four combinations covered for each class:

* @(a, a)@               — non-nullable × non-nullable
* @(Maybe a, a)@         — nullable × non-nullable
* @(a, Maybe a)@         — non-nullable × nullable
* @(Maybe a, Maybe a)@   — both nullable

== Usage

@
-- Mixing nullable and non-nullable columns:
F.col \@Int \"x\" '.+' F.col \@(Maybe Int) \"y\"  -- :: Expr (Maybe Int)

-- Both non-nullable (existing behaviour preserved):
F.col \@Int \"x\" '.+' F.col \@Int \"y\"           -- :: Expr Int

-- Comparison with three-valued logic:
F.col \@(Maybe Int) \"x\" '.==' F.col \@Int \"y\"  -- :: Expr (Maybe Bool)

ensures the more specific @(Maybe a, Maybe a)@ instance wins when both operands
are nullable.
